	decode_tight.c, encode.c, encode_tight.c, host_connect.c,
	host_io.c, main.c, rect.c, rect.h, region.c, region.h, rfblib.h,
	translate.c: Ported X region stuff, from miregion.c. This will
	allow the Reflector to maintain not just a list of rectangles in
	the same order as received from the host, but an X region structure
	which consists of non-overlapped rectangles.

2002-09-18 18:01  const

	implementation to compare performance.

2001-10-11 21:31  const

	* host_io.c: The hextile_fill_subrect function optimized. The

	space for further optimization.

2001-10-11 19:48  const

	* host_io.c: hextile_fill_tile function optimized for speed.
	Profiling results for test session: original implementation
	consumed 66% of all process time when dealing with host connection,
	optimized version consumes only 20% time. Now this function is the
	second time consumer in host interaction after hextile_fill_subrect
	function.

2001-10-11 19:20  const

	* translate.c: Added another variant of the color translation
	function, which is should be faster in most situation. Profiling

2001-10-10 18:18  const

	* encode.c, encode.h: Major changes in structures implementing
	cache for screen updates. Now the "hints" can hold only meta-data
	(color info) but Hextile-encoded data may be absent. This design
	makes the cache more usable for other encoders such as Tight.
	Besides that, Hextile data is kept in its original form, not in a
	semi-parsed representation.

2001-10-10 13:36  const

	* encode.c: Minor change in comment.

2001-10-10 13:33  const

	encoder.

2001-10-09 17:34  const

	* encode.c, encode.h: Major re-organization in the Hextile encoder
	code, to better arrange the code between functions, and to separate
	caching in the future, to simplify re-using of the caching code by
	other encoders such as Tight.

	* async_io.c, async_io.h, control.c, host_connect.c,
	host_connect.h, host_io.c, host_io.h: Reversed host -> client
	connection. Many fixes of incorrect logic both in async I/O library
	and in the reflector itself. Now re-connecting code should work
	much more reliable.

2001-08-27 15:37  const

	* async_io.c, async_io.h: Now async I/O library should be able to
	listen on more than one fd.  Special listening type of AIO_SLOT
	introduced. However, external interface with I/O library was not
	changed.

2001-08-26 22:20  const

	* client_io.c: Clients' pointer events are not passed directly to
	host any more. Now we make sure that x and y position fit into the
	host's screen.

	* client_io.c, encode.c, host_connect.c, host_io.c, main.c,
	reflector.h, rfblib.h, translate.c: g_screen_info is allocated
	statically, only screen name is allocated with malloc(). More
	debugging output in client_io.c.

2001-08-24 16:15  const

	* async_io.c, async_io.h: Previous versions of async I/O library
	used to remember only one hook function supposed to be called after

2001-08-18 17:44  const

	* Makefile, translate.c, translate.h: Work on fast pixel format
	translation has been started. Null translation function and
	functions to fill in translation tables are ready but not tested

	* client_io.c, client_io.h: Hextile encoding is used only when a
	client prefers it to raw.

2001-08-11 09:49  const

	* reflector.h: Version string changed, version 0.8.

2001-08-11 09:49  const

	* client_io.c, encode.c, encode.h: Hextile encoder implemented.

2001-08-11 09:48  const

	* Makefile: A space removed. :-)

2001-08-11 09:47  const

	* rfblib.c, rfblib.h: buf_get_CARD* and buf_put_CARD* functions
	replaced by macros.

2001-08-08 21:42  const

	* host_connect.c, host_io.c, rfblib.h: Added support for CopyRect
	encoding on host side.

2001-08-08 19:56  const

	* client_io.c, rect.c, rect.h: Got rid of extra parameter in
	rlist_add_rect function.

2001-08-08 19:34  const

	ClientCutText messages from clients to host.

2001-08-08 18:17  const

	* client_io.c, client_io.h: Properly ignoring FixColourMapEntries
	message received from clients.

2001-08-08 18:04  const

	* client_io.c: Bugfix: Setting up correct initial pixel format for
	clients.

2001-08-08 16:52  const

	* client_io.c: Now we disconnect non-authorized clients correctly
	after sending "auth failed" notification. We used to drop such
	connections too early.

2001-08-08 16:49  const

	* host_connect.c: Minor changes in log messages text.

2001-08-08 16:48  const

	* async_io.c: Minor bugfix.

2001-08-08 16:36  const

	* client_io.c, client_io.h, host_io.c, main.c: ServerCutText
	message is now passed from host to clients. If password set for
	clients is empty, we don't ask for authentication anymore.

2001-08-07 21:00  const

	* client_io.c: Bugfix: we should not queue rectangles for clients
	that have not passed protocol handshaking phase yet.

2001-08-07 06:30  const

	* host_connect.c, host_io.c, rfblib.h: Hextile decoder implemented
	to get hextile-encoded data from host.

2001-08-05 05:25  const

	* client_io.c: Log levels corrected.

2001-08-05 05:23  const

	* Makefile, client_io.c, host_io.c, host_io.h: Pointer and keyboard
	events are now passed to the host.

2001-08-05 05:06  const

	* reflector.h: Version string changed.

2001-08-05 05:06  const

	* client_io.c, client_io.h: Now we respect FramebufferUpdateRequest

2001-08-05 04:58  const

	* Makefile, async_io.c, async_io.h, client_io.c, client_io.h,
	encode.c, encode.h, host_io.c, main.c, rect.c, rect.h: Incremental
	updates for clients implemented.

2001-08-05 00:32  const

	* Makefile: Dependencies.

2001-08-05 00:29  const

	* Makefile, client_io.c, client_io.h, encode.c, encode.h,
	host_connect.c, host_io.c, rfblib.h: Correct processing of
	FramebufferUpdateRequest client messages, better way to send
	FramebufferUpdate messages, correct color translation, improved I/O
	error handling, a number of code cleanups.

2001-08-05 00:25  const

	* async_io.c, async_io.h: New aio_write_nocopy function to queue
	output data without copying it into newly-allocated memory.

2001-08-04 19:43  const

	* Makefile: Using gccmakedep as makedepend.

2001-08-04 19:26  const

	* async_io.c: Disabling exit on SIGPIPE signal.

2001-08-03 20:06  const

	* Makefile, client_io.c, client_io.h, host_connect.c,
	host_connect.h, host_io.c, main.c, reflector.h, rfblib.c, rfblib.h:
	Finally, now we send framebuffer updates to clients. Currently,
	this is done in a _very_ inefficient way, full raw framebuffer is
	sent after each update request. Color format translation does not
	work yet.  Anyway, this is the first version where remote screen
	can be seen.

2001-08-03 14:34  const

	* Makefile, client_io.c, client_io.h, main.c: New CL_SLOT structure
	extends AIO_SLOT to keep client state for each client connection.

2001-08-03 13:52  const

	* async_io.c, async_io.h, client_io.c, host_io.c, main.c: Now
	clients' IP addresses are kept in I/O slot structure, in text form,
	and reported to logs in messages caused by client connections.

2001-08-03 02:50  const

	* async_io.c, async_io.h, client_io.c, host_io.c, main.c: Finally,
	we can watch for errors on connections and can close connections
	correctly on errors or on intention.

2001-08-02 23:50  const

	* main.c: Minor cleanups.

2001-08-02 23:47  const

	* Makefile, client_io.c, client_io.h, main.c: More client
	interaction implemented, at this moment up to authentication and
	receiving ClientInitialisation message.

2001-08-02 22:54  const

	* main.c: New -v option to set log verbosity level, option -f now
	requires argument, also verbosity level, but for stderr messages.

2001-08-02 22:33  const

	* Makefile, async_io.c, async_io.h, client_io.c, client_io.h,
	main.c: Now we successfully accept client connections and are able
	to read RFB versions clients require.

2001-08-02 20:37  const

	* host_io.c: Now we understand and process correctly all 4 types of
	RFB server-to-client messages.

2001-08-02 19:18  const

	* main.c: Switching to the background mode when there was no -f
	option.

2001-08-02 18:53  const

	* host_io.c, main.c, rfblib.h: Raw-encoded framebuffer updates now
	should place pixels in correct areas of the local framebuffer.

2001-08-02 18:23  const

	* Makefile, host_connect.c, host_connect.h, hostconnect.c,
	hostconnect.h, main.c: hostconnect.* renamed into host_connect.*

2001-08-02 18:15  const

	* .cvsignore: Putting .cvsignore under the CVS control. :-)

2001-08-02 18:13  const

	* Makefile, async_io.c, async_io.h, dispatch.c, dispatch.h,
	host_io.c, host_io.h, hostconnect.c, main.c: Async I/O library
	implementation seems to work now, the program is able to receive
	framebuffer updates from host using new I/O stuff. The code from
	dispatch.c has been split into async_io.c and host_io.c, old
	dispatch.c is obsolete, removed from sources.

2001-08-02 16:35  const

	* dispatch.c: Correction in a format string for log_write().

2001-08-02 02:55  const

	* async_io.c, async_io.h: Async I/O library implementation, not
	finished yet.

2001-08-01 23:06  const

	* Makefile, dispatch.c, hostconnect.c, rfblib.c, rfblib.h: Ok, now
	the program is able to receive framebuffer updates continuously in
	non-blocking mode. Note: the code in dispatch is far from being
	ideal, it should have been re-organized and unified.

2001-08-01 18:49  const

	* Makefile, dispatch.c, dispatch.h, main.c, reflector.h: Added
	dispatch.h, dispatch.c.

2001-08-01 18:35  const

	* Makefile: Dependency information included, only dependencies
	within current directory.

2001-08-01 18:32  const

	* main.c, reflector.h: Allocating framebuffer.	Configuration
	options made local to main.c.  read_pasword_file() now always
	returns 1.  Error on log_close() is reported on stderr only in
	foreground mode.

2001-08-01 18:29  const

	* rfblib.h: bytes_row member added to RFB_DESKTOP_INFO structure.

2001-08-01 18:18  const

	* Makefile: Dependency information made with makedepend removed.

2001-08-01 11:58  const

	* Makefile, d3des.c, d3des.h, hostconnect.c, hostconnect.h,
	logging.c, logging.h, main.c, reflector.h, rfblib.h: Initial
	revision

2001-08-01 11:58  const

	* Makefile, d3des.c, d3des.h, hostconnect.c, hostconnect.h,
	logging.c, logging.h, main.c, reflector.h, rfblib.h: Sources placed
	into CVS tree
